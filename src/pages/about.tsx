        INSTUDIA have been imparting various training program to the people of
        different categories of the society, and filling up the gap and
        fulfilling the needs of our unemployed youth and giving the employment
        directly or indirectly. Today, simple secular qualification does not fit
        into the vacant post be it a public, private or government sector. On
        the other hand the candidate earn lesser as they do not map with the
        specific requirements. It need additional skill beside the required
        secular qualification. The need for being SKILLED may be seen in the
        unemployed youth as well as the working youth. Getting trained in the
        computer has become compulsory for every person. We have been providing
        the high technical computer education as well as vocational courses, at
        the nominal fee affordable to any section of the society, mainly
        benefiting the lower or middle class.

        There was a time when many educated people also believed that computer
        literacy & Internet was of no use in Nagaland. Many people believed that
        youths of Nagaland may not be able to cope up with the IT technologies.
        On the other hand vocational trainings are taken up only by the school
        drop outs, unemployed youth for whom the only last option is to get
        occupied or engaged in a training or the other so that either they learn
        a trade or be within the control of institution/organization to be
        disciplined.

        Today, the concept is changed and is changing. Youths of Nagaland want
        to be self- dependent. We see many Nagas in IT hub of the country so
        also in various professional field bringing laurels & revenue for the
        state. Understanding the need and requirement to fill in the gap and the
        economic condition of our society, we have moved towards skilling so as
        to adapt oneself in order to be self-dependent. Not all can do or fit
        into the IT and ITES work. Keeping in mind the current market scenario,
        the requirement is so huge that our current generation need to skill up
        their talent and creativity which need a proper reskilling besides the
        secular educational qualification. Our Team has been striving hard to
        eradicate the menace of unemployment from Nagaland through placements
        coveted IT Jobs available nationally and locally too.
