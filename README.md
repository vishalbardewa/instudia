### Customization

You can easily configure Next js Boilerplate. Please change the following file:

- `public/apple-touch-icon.png`, `public/favicon.ico`, `public/favicon-16x16.png` and `public/favicon-32x32.png`: your website favicon, you can generate from https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/
- `src/styles/global.css`: your CSS file using Tailwind CSS
- `src/utils/AppConfig.ts`: configuration file
- `src/templates/Main.tsx`: default theme

### Deploy to production

You can see the results locally in production mode with:

```
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```

The generated HTML and CSS files are minified (built-in feature from Next js). It will also removed unused CSS from [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

You can create an optimized production build with:

```
npm run build-prod
```

Now, your blog is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at `out` folder, which you can deploy with any hosting service.
